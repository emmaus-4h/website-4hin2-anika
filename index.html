          At the left side you can see the logo of blackpink. There are two colors "Black and Pink". 

      

          <ul>
            <ol><strong>The meaning of these colors:</strong></ol>
             <ol><em>Pink</em> means their cute, cheerful side</ol>
             <ol> <em>Black</em> means their mature, girl crush side </ol><br>
          </ul>

        &ensp;The name '<em>Blackpink</em>' means ‘<em>pretty isn't everything</em>'. The members didn't want them to be just know as they are pretty but also that they are talented, hardworking, mature and genuine.
