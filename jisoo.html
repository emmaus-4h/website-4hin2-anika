      <h3>Her early life</h3>
      <p>&ensp;&ensp;<strong>Kim Jisoo</strong> was born in the city of Gunpo, south of Seoul in South Korea’s Gyeonggi
        province, in January 1995. The youngest of three siblings, she played basketball and took taekwondo lessons, and
        was a huge fan of legendary boy band TVXQ as a child. She attended the famous School of Performing Arts Seoul
        high school and became a trainee with YG Entertainment in 2011.
      <p>

      <p> &ensp;&ensp;Jisoo was slowly, and cryptically, introduced to the general public, with YG initially unveiling
        her as “<em>Mystery Girl No 2</em>”, before her picture and name was revealed in early 2013.</p>



      <p>&ensp;&ensp;She became a hot K-pop commodity years before her official debut with Blackpink. She made cameos in
        music videos by a range of K-pop acts (including Epik High and Hi Suhyun in 2014), landed endorsement deals
        (with brands including LG, Nikon and Samsonite), made TV appearances (the variety show 1 Night 2 Days in 2015),
        and began an acting career (in the 2015 South Korean drama The Producers).
      </p>

      <p>&ensp;&ensp;Interest was so high that Jisoo received an offer to join rival label SM Entertainment when a
        manager tried to recruit her at a concert.</p><br>



      <h3>Her role in Blackpink</h3>

      <p>
        &ensp;&ensp;The Blackpink members were introduced with a week-long roll-out of photos showing off their various
        styles ahead of their 2016 summer debut.
      </p>

      <p>&ensp;&ensp;Jisoo was the third revealed, before her singing skills and visual beauty were put on full display
        in Blackpink’s explosive debut singles.</p>

      <p>&ensp;&ensp;While Blackpink members do not have designated roles, Jisoo has been noted for keeping the group’s
        vocal harmonies together.</p>

      <p>&ensp;&ensp;Fellow member Jennie told Billboard magazine that “<em>Jisoo would be the quiet one, but then she’d
          be like, ‘How about this?’ She’d make this harmony, and we were like, ‘That’s so good!’ and then in an hour
          have another amazing harmony.</em>”</p>

      <p>&ensp;&ensp;Jisoo is also known for her unpredictable and quirky “<em>4D</em>” personality that comes out
        during TV shows and live events. Fans know she has a peculiar love of trying to balance items on her body – she
        was once caught on camera trying to balance a water bottle on her shoulder at a 2017 awards show.</p><br>


      <h3>In her own words</h3>

      <p>&ensp;&ensp;<strong>Jisoo’s career has been long and unconventional, but she has said that throughout it all,
          she depended on no one but herself.</strong></p>

      <p>&ensp;&ensp;“<em>When I look back at the time that’s passed, it makes me think that I’m actually quite a strong
          person,” she told Elle Korea in 2019.</em></p>

      <p><em>&ensp;&ensp;“Even when I was going through difficult times, I never really thought about relying on others
          … I think it’s because of the tough times I endured alone that I was able to become this strong.”</em></p>



      <p>&ensp;&ensp;<strong>Ultimately, Jisoo’s journey is about sharing that strength with those who look up to her –
          especially young girls.</strong></p>

      <p><em>&ensp;&ensp;“I want to tell young girls to try thinking of their future selves as their role models. Rather
          than chasing after [being] someone else, I hope that they will confidently walk their own paths while looking
          towards the tomorrow of their dreams.</em></p>

      <p><em>&ensp;&ensp;“I, myself, have tried following people around me, and I’ve got lost and ended up feeling
          emptiness rather than a sense of accomplishment. I’d like everyone to find their own role models within
          themselves.”</em></p><br>


      <h3>Solo Debut Album by Jisoo</h3>
      <p>&ensp;&ensp;"<em>Flower</em>" (Korean: 꽃; RR: Kkot) is the debut solo single by South Korean singer and
        Blackpink member Jisoo. It was released on March 31, 2023, through YG and Interscope as the lead single from her
        debut single album, Me.</p>
