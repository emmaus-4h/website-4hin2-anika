<h3>Her early life</h3>

       <p>&ensp;&ensp;Rosé's Korean name is <strong>Park Chaeyoung</strong> and her English name is <strong>Roseanne Park</strong>. Her family consists of her mother, a businesswoman, her father, a lawyer, and her sister, Alice Park, four years her senior and also a lawyer. She was born in Auckland, New Zealand and raised in Melbourne, Australia. For her education, Rosé attended Canterbury Girls’ Secondary College in Melbourne, Australia. As a child, Rosé always had a passion for singing and was a part of her church's choir.</p>

       <p>&ensp;&ensp;In 2012, Rosé's father found out that YG Entertainment was holding their auditions in Sydney, Australia. He convinced her to take part in it. Despite Rosé's mother not agreeing at first, Rosé and her father were able to convince her mother at the end. She quickly went to Sydney, coming all the way from Melbourne. Rosé ranked first in the auditions, beating 700 others, and became a trainee at YG Entertainment on the same day. After training for four years, YG finally put her as the main vocalist and lead dancer of BLACKPINK. She was the last member to be revealed in the band.</p>

       <p>&ensp;&ensp;Less than 6 months after joining YG, Rosé featured on G-Dragon's One of a Kind EP, on the track "<em>Without You</em>".</p>


       <h3>Artistry</h3>
<p>&ensp;&ensp;Rosé's voice has received acknowledgment in the K-Pop industry for its distinct vocal timbre. Following her debut as a member of Blackpink, Rosé's vocal color was largely met with praise. Filipina critic Almira Blancada, writing for ABS-CBN, stated that "<em>it's hard to find an idol [singer] who stands out from the rest</em>" due to their "common singing style", but "<em>you would know it's Rosé singing in a heartbeat</em>". Following Rosé's performance on an episode of Fantastic Duo 2, South Korean singer Gummy, who Rosé cited as a musical role model, stated that "<em>Rosé's voice is so unique, it's the [type of] voice young people love</em>”. Rosé has also been acknowledged for having a wide vocal range. As a musician, Rosé considers American singer Tori Kelly an inspiration of her musical style.</p>

<h3>Endorsements</h3>
       <p>&ensp;&ensp;In 2018, Rosé and fellow Blackpink member Jisoo were selected as endorsement models for the South Korean cosmetics brand Kiss Me. She has also been invited to various designer launching events and showcases, such as Alessandro Dell'Acqua's Capsule Collection in Gangnam, Alexander McQueen's 2018 fall-winter collection exhibition in Seongdong, and Coach's 2018 pre-fall collection in Shanghai.</p><br>
