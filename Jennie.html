      <h3>Her early life</h3>
      
      <p>&ensp;&ensp;<strong>Jennie Kim</strong> was born on January 16, 1996, in Cheongdam-dong, Gangnam-gu, Seoul. Being the only child, she attended Cheongdam Elementary School in Seoul before moving to New Zealand where she had a life-changing experience. When she was eight, she visited Australia and New Zealand with her family. Moreover, after expressing her fondness for New Zealand, she was sent to study at Waikowhai Intermediate School in Auckland and lived with a homestay family.</p> 

            <p>&ensp;&ensp;Jennie’s experience learning a new language was documented on MBC’s English, Must Change to Survive in 2006. During her teenage years, she dreamed of becoming a ballet dancer. After finishing intermediate, she enrolled at ACG Parnell College.</p> 

            <p>&ensp;&ensp;It was in New Zealand where Jennie first discovered K-pop and developed an interest in YG Entertainment’s music. However, her mother planned to move her to Florida to continue her studies to become a lawyer or teacher when she turned 14. Jennie wasn’t thrilled with the idea, and instead, she moved back to South Korea in 2010 to study at Cheongdam Middle School. Her family supported her decision, and that same year, Jennie auditioned for YG Entertainment with Rihanna’s “Take a Bow” and was accepted as a trainee.
